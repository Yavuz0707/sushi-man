# Firebase Configuration Template
# 
# This file contains placeholder Firebase configuration.
# You need to create a Firebase project and get your own credentials.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
# 2. Create a new project or select existing one
# 3. Add a Flutter app to your project
# 4. Download the configuration files:
#    - For Android: google-services.json → Place in android/app/
#    - For iOS: GoogleService-Info.plist → Place in ios/Runner/
# 5. Enable Authentication (Email/Password) in Firebase Console
# 6. Enable Cloud Firestore in Firebase Console
# 7. Set up Firestore security rules (see README.md)
#
# For FlutterFire CLI setup (recommended):
# 1. Install FlutterFire CLI: dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
# 2. Run: flutterfire configure
# 3. Select your Firebase project
# 4. Follow the prompts

# This will automatically:
# - Configure your Flutter app with Firebase
# - Generate firebase_options.dart file
# - Set up native configuration files

# If you're using FlutterFire CLI, uncomment and use this in main.dart:
# import 'firebase_options.dart';
# await Firebase.initializeApp(
#   options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
# );
